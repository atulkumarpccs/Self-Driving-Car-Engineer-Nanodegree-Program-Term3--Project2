Label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).
### Introduction
In this project, you'll label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

### Setup
##### GPU
`main.py` will check to make sure you are using GPU - if you don't have a GPU on your system, you can use AWS or another cloud computing platform.
##### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

You may also need [Python Image Library (PIL)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) for SciPy's `imresize` function.

##### Dataset
Download the [Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).  Extract the dataset in the `data` folder.  This will create the folder `data_road` with all the training a test images.

### Start
##### Implement
Implement the code in the `main.py` module indicated by the "TODO" comments.
The comments indicated with "OPTIONAL" tag are not required to complete.
##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py
```
**Note** If running this in Jupyter Notebook system messages, such as those regarding test status, may appear in the terminal rather than the notebook.

### Submission
1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests.
2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/989/view).
3. Submit the following in a zip file.
 - `helper.py`
 - `main.py`
 - `project_tests.py`
 - Newest inference images from `runs` folder  (**all images from the most recent run**)
 
### Tips
- The link for the frozen `VGG16` model is hardcoded into `helper.py`.  The model can be found [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/vgg.zip).
- The model is not vanilla `VGG16`, but a fully convolutional version, which already contains the 1x1 convolutions to replace the fully connected layers. Please see this [post](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/forum_archive/Semantic_Segmentation_advice.pdf) for more information.  A summary of additional points, follow. 
- The original FCN-8s was trained in stages. The authors later uploaded a version that was trained all at once to their GitHub repo.  The version in the GitHub repo has one important difference: The outputs of pooling layers 3 and 4 are scaled before they are fed into the 1x1 convolutions.  As a result, some students have found that the model learns much better with the scaling layers included. The model may not converge substantially faster, but may reach a higher IoU and accuracy. 
- When adding l2-regularization, setting a regularizer in the arguments of the `tf.layers` is not enough. Regularization loss terms must be manually added to your loss function. otherwise regularization is not implemented.

### Optional sections
Within `main.py`, there are a few optional sections you can also choose to implement, but are not required for the project.

1. Train and perform inference on the [Cityscapes Dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/). Note that the `project_tests.py` is not currently set up to also unit test for this alternate dataset. Cityscapes is a much more extensive dataset, with segmentation of 30 different classes (compared to road vs. not road on KITTI) on either 5,000 finely annotated images or 20,000 coarsely annotated images.
2. Add image augmentation. You can use some of the augmentation techniques you may have used on Traffic Sign Classification or Behavioral Cloning, or look into additional methods for more robust training!
3. Apply the trained model to a video. This project only involves performing inference on a set of test images, but you can also try to utilize it on a full video.
